# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview & Purpose

In this challenge scenario, Roza is a microbiologist whose research lab has partnered with Impossible Beef, a startup company, to discover and document bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species can be found in the human belly button. To test her hypothesis, she sampled navels of anonymous volunteers across the country. 

The purpose of this challenge was to build a dashboard that both participants and researchers can access. Participants will be able to use their assigned ID number to find out what bacterial species live in their navels.

## Results

First, I created a panel for demographic information with a dropdown menu for volunteers to access:

Then I created three interactive charts to visualize the information:

Finally, I customized the dashboard to be more visually appealing by adding an image to the jumbotron (header) and a paragraph providing guidance to the volunteers:

I also added color to the charts as shown above.

Now, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
