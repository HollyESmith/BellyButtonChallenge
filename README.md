# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview & Purpose
In this challenge scenario, Roza is a microbiolog completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.  That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Overview & Purpose

In this challenge scenario, Roza is a microbiologist whose goal is to discover and document bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef can be found in the human belly button. To test her hypothesis, she sampled navels of anonymous volunteers across the country. 

The purpose of this challenge was to build a dashboard that both participants and researchers can access. Participants will be able to use their assigned ID number to find out what bacterial species live in their navels.

## Results

First, I created a panel for demographic information with a dropdown menu for volunteers to access:
